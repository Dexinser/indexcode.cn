# People don't forget their 20s.
说一下This is us 这部美剧吧！刚刚把昨天更新的S02E06看完了。这一集中讲述的挺真实的，讲的是兄妹三人在人生20s中遇到的种种挫折。兰德尔虽然在事业上获得了巨大的成功，成为了我们所说的成功人士，但是也有这个时期的烦恼或者说是压力，对任何事情都感到很茫然，除了工作。因为他的Tessa马上就要来到他的面前了，他害怕做不好一个父亲的职责..
>Eastern wisdom is kind of a thing.
>G(Garuda): -I will tell you one thing. I have five kids. And before first one was born, I was all questions, too. Can I? Will I? But they don't tell you is that babies come with the answers. They come out, they look up at you, and you at them, and...they tell you who you are. You'll see. Tomorrow you'll have all the answers you need.

凯文和凯特过的都不好，凯文刚刚从父亲的阴影中走出来，而凯特依然沉浸在失去父亲的悲伤中，迟迟的不能走出悲伤接受事实..而丽贝卡也依然沉浸在过去之中，怀念着过去的丈夫..主要讲的是孩子们在人生中的20s这个时间段内所遇到的挫折..而捱过这段难熬的是家人之间的陪伴，又一次深深的被这部暖心剧所感动了。

# Happening for us in the 20s.

>Kate: -Crushing the 20s.
>Kevin: -Bam. I haven't had an audition in, like, six months.
>Kate: -The new guy is married.
>Kevin: -Real--oh.
>Kate: -Thanks. Have a little more.
>Kevin: -Okay. Married, huh?
>Kate: -Yeah.But he's nice, which makes it harder. He asks questions. He knows my class schedule.
>Kevin: -I mean, come on, that's, you know, that's-that's a..that's a low bar.
>Kate: -You really haven't had an audition in six months?
>Kevin: -No, it's been more like a year, actually. Where are you at? I mean, what are you...You still sitting in your car, eating fast food, staring at where the house used to be? He's gone. Okey? And he's not coming back, and even if you sit there in the exact same spot that you were when he left, he's not...coming back.
>Kate: -I know.
>Kevin: -And he wouldn't want you to stay. Not if there was nothing for you there. You know what he'd want for you? Everything.
>Kate: -Yeah, for you, too.
>Kevin: -You know, maybe I'll take an acting class. I know it's...Or join a crappy improv troupe. I guess I could do that.
>Kate: -That's the spirit. Yes. I bet you're hilarious.
>Kevin: -I'm probably a pretty funny guy.

# Life is not end, this monent is a new begining.
>Rebecca: -Hi, little boy. I'm sorry it took me so long to get over here. I was really nervous to meet you. See...I talked to my other babies over there the whole time they were inside of me. But you weren't there, so...I want to come and introduce myself. And say hello and let you hear my voice.

>Rebecca: -Hi, little sweet girl. I want to properly welcome you to the world. You are.. beautiful. Oh, my godness. I mean, all babies are beautiful, but you...you are Randall and Beth beautiful. And that is special. You know...I've been here before, Tess. You think you're at the beginning of your journey, right? But you also began a long time age. Do you know that? 'Cause I was there, and somebody else was there, too. Somebody really good. And we lost a baby, and we thought it was an ending, but...it was also a beginning.'

>Rebecca: -Do you see those guys over there? That's your brother and sister. That's Kevin and Kate. And the man, the sweet man who fed you this afternoon. That's your dad.

>Rebecca: -And life has a middle, too, and middles can be the hardest because...that's when you can get really lost. But middles can be beginning sometimes. And if you're lucky, you can have it all. And you...are lucky. You are the luckiest, prettiest, sweetest baby ever named after a ceiling fan.

>Rebecca: -I think I...forgot to introduce myself. I'm your mom.

>Rebecca: -You know, I thought my journey had come to an end, but I don't know. I don't know. Maybe...maybe we're both at out next beginning.

Always be a good man. Cause life is amazing. You don't know what is the time of moving coming.
生活如此美好，引无数英雄竞折腰。

慢慢都会变好的~~~
